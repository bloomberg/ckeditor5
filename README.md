## What is this repository?

This repository is a fork of CKSource's CKEditor 5 repository, created so that Bloomberg's
engineering team can collaborate with each other (and the rest of the CKEditor 5 community)
on enhancements to CKEditor 5. Branches in this repository represent 'work in progress' that
will be contributed to the CKSource CKEditor 5 repository when the work is ready for review.

If you have any questions about the branches in this repository, feel free to open an issue
so our team can discuss them with you.
